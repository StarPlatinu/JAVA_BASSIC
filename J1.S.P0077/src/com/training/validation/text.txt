In order to track temporal hours during the day, inventors created sundials, which indicate 
time by the length or direction of the sun's shadow. The sundial's counterpart, the 
water clock, was designed to measure temporal hours at night. One of the first water 
clocks was a basin with a small hole near the bottom through which the water dripped 
out. The falling water level denoted the passing hour as it dipped below hour lines 
inscribed on the inner surface. Although these devices performed satisfactorily around 
the Mediterranean, they could not always be depended on in the cloudy and often freezing 
weather of northern Europe.
